<b>Game Basics</b><br/>
Once you press the launch button a whack a mole game will be launched in another screen.  It's constructed just like the traditional funfair game, with the task being to hit moles.
<br/><br/>
You need to whack (that is touch your touch screen) the moles as they emerge from their holes before they disappear back down them.  If you hit the mole in time and on target then the game will reward you with a hit with a probability based upon how close your were to the mole's nose.  
<br/><br/>
While the game is skill based, sometimes your score will not be based on how close to a mole's nose you were, but on random luck...
<br/><br/>
Specifically, when the game is predominantly skill 80% of the time your score will bw be decided by how close to a mole's nose your hit was and 20% of the time it will be random.
<br/><br/>
Likewise, when the game is predominantly luck based, 80% of the time your score will be random and 20% of the time it will be decided by how close to a mole's nose your hit was.
<br/><br/>
Periodically the game will flip between luck and skill.  You won't know which condition you're in, but we will ask for your insight after each attempted mole whack on a bar and the resulting score, where you are required to estiamte whether the game is predominantly luck or skill at that time,
<br/><br/>
The game will pause regularly for feedback in the bar, but should you want to pause the game at any time click 'p'.  Should you want to quit click 'ctr' + 'q'.
<br/><br/>
To get you fmiliar with the game there are three demo stages initially.  The first 10 mole whacks is the game without any random element, the second 10 mole whacks is the game in the 'Luck' environment, and the final 10 mole whacks is the game in the 'Skill' environment.  After that you'll start the game!

When you're ready to play, click the launch button on the bottom right.

Happy Whacking!
