<b>Game Basics</b><br/>
Once you press the launch button a whack a mole game will be launched in another screen.  It's constructed just like the traditional funfair game, with the task being to hit moles.
<br/><br/>
Specifically you need to whack (that is touch your touch screen) the moles as they emerge from their holes before they disappear back down them.  IF you hit the mole in time and on target then the game will reward you with a hit with a probability based upon how close your were to the mole's nose.  While the game is skill based, in addition to your manual skill a degree of luck exists, where your reward is sometimes not what you would expect...
<br/><br/>
<b>Game Conditions</b><br/>
The unexpected outcomes are governed by 4 condition combinations within the game:
<br/><br/>
<b>1. High skill + high luck:</b><br/> where you require very precise mole hits to receive a reward, but also have a large random component that moderates this skill
<br/><br/>
<b>2. High skill + low luck:</b><br/> where you require very precise mole hits to receive a reward, with very little random-ness to perturb the result
<br/><br/>
<b>3. Low skill + high luck:</b><br/> where hitting a mole requires significantly less precision to receive a reward, but also have a large random component that moderates this skill
<br/><br/>
<b>4. Low skill + low luck:</b><br/> where hitting a mole requires significantly less precision to receive a reward,  with very little random-ness to perturb the result
<br/><br/>
You won't know which condition you're in, but we will ask for your insight after each attempted mole whack in a two by two grid, where you are required to estimate the confidence in a mole hit and the degree of luck vs skill that resulted in the outcome
<br/><br/>
The game will pause regularly for feedback in the two by two grid, but should you want to pause the game at any time click 'p'.  Should you want to quit click 'ctr' + 'q'.
<br/><br/>
When you're ready to play, click the launch button on the bottom right.

Happy Whacking!
